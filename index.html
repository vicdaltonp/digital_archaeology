<p>What is Digital Arcaheology? What types of changes may occur over the next five years? How may these changes affect the nature of Digital Archaeology? Can Digital Archaeology be done with integrity and still be both entertaining and educational?</p>

      <p>These are the types of questions this project seeks to address. As a relatively young discipline in an increaingly digitized world, there are many questions surrounding the future of Digital Archaeology. Furthermore, there are even questions concerning the current state of Digital Archaeology. From technology and ethics to method and theory, there are multiple components of Digital Archaeology that currently concern the discipline and those involved.</p>
      
      <p>One can approach the concerns of Digital Archaeology in a two-fold manner: what is the current state of Digitial Archaeology and what may its future hold? Through this duality, one can explore the above questions in greater detail. Since many of the questions surrounding the nature of Digital Archaeology are still not entirely clear, taking this approach allows one to shed some light on the current issues of Digital Archaeology. Moreover, it is important to address these concerns even if no answers can be reached, since the questions facing Digital Archaeologists can often be quite significant for the future of the discipline.</p>
