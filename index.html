<p>What is Digital Arcaheology? What types of changes may occur over the next five years? How may these changes affect the nature of Digital Archaeology? Can Digital Archaeology be done with integrity and still be both entertaining and educational?</p>

      <p>These are the types of questions this project seeks to address. As a relatively young field in an increaingly digitized world, there are many questions surrounding the future of Digital Archaeology. From technology and ethics to method and theory, there are many issues with which digital archaeologists are currently grappling, and the future of Digital Archaeology rests with how such issues are approached over the next few years.</p>
      
      <p>Moreover, Digital Archaeology can be effectively approached in a two-fold manner: what is its current state and what may its future hold? Since many of the questions and concerns surrounding the nature of Digital Archaeology are still not entirely clear, or necessarily answerable for that matter, this dual approach offers a well-rounded exploration of Digital Archaeology. Moreover, it is important to address the concerns facing Digital Archaeology even if no answers can be reached, since the questions facing digital archaeologists may be quite significant for the future of the discipline.</p>
      
<h3> <a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Method</h3>
    
<p>So how will this project proceed? Above are several links that can be followed to different components of this project:</p>
      
      <p><b>The Discipline</b> explores the current nature of Digital Archaeology as an emerging discipline, and poses some preliminary questions regarding how it may continue to develop.</p>
      
      <p><b>The Technology</b> looks at how different technologies are currently being applied in Digital Archaeology. Additionally, it explores how technological developments may impact Digital Archaeology in upcoming years.</p>
      
      <p><b>The Method and Theory</b> examines some of the current aims and practices of Digital Archaeology. Considering current Digital Archaeology, additional questions arise in regards to how methods and theories may change as the discipline itself develops.</p>
      
      <p><b>The Ethics</b> investigates some of the concerns regarding the ethical principles, or lackthereof, that currently exists in Digital Archaeology. As the discipline develops, ethical concerns will inevitably assume a prominent position, so it is important to adress the current state of ethics in Digital Archaeology.</p>
      
      <p><b>The Questions</b> concludes this project by considering some of the aforementioned concerns and posing additional questions for the future.</p>
      
      <p>Overall, this project will explore multiple components of Digital Archaeology in a way that both considers the present and questions the future. While there are many ways to approach this topic, it is hoped that this project will offer readers a stepping stone to explore further issues. In short, these are important questions that archaeologists must consider in this increasingly digital world in order to understand the direction that archaeology seems to be headed.</p>
